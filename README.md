# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


The scheduler was a good project to pull several pieces of the Boot Camp together.  I enjoyed working thru the existing CSS to setup the HTML and trying to match what it appeared the developer was looking for.  

The office hours TAs were a great help for completing the connection between the CSS and moment.js pieces for me.  I had the right structure, I just needed some help with the jquery each loop.

I was not able to get the local storage piece figured out.  I think i'm on the right track but i'm not fully understanding how it works to do the coding.
